Project: Design and Implementation of a high-fidelity, practical smart grid honeypot for gathering threat intelligence Honeypot for industrial control systems (ICS) is still in an early stage. While there are a number of implementations, to our knowledge none of them offers high-interaction, cyber-physical integrated experience to deceive attackers, and therefore is suitable for retaining attackers inside for conducting longitudinal attack analysis. Besides, logging on honeypot systems that allow us to conduct analysis of attack vectors and threat intelligence has not yet been well studied or implemented. In this project, we tackle these challenges towards a practical, high-fidelity ICS honeypot in smart grid domain that offers better realism from attacker’s perspective and effective logging features for security and threat analysis. We are currently looking for a Software Engineer to conduct research and development for a new project on securing the communication networks and intelligent devices in smart grid.

While Big Data has been instrumental in helping organizations gain a better understanding of their world, not many organizations have been able to successfully translate that understanding to optimal actions that can drive their business objectives.
This failure to easily harness Big Data, to drive actionable insights and to execute actions in a changing world in real-time spurred the Unscrambl team to come up with a better approach. There were a few key realizations. The first is that analytics and actions had to be industry and use-case specific to allow easy adoption and execution. The second is that real-time matters: the quicker you are to act, the quicker you are to succeed, or fail. And the third is that the world is always changing, so we need to be able to observe the effect of our actions, continuously update our model of the world and continuously evolve our decisions and strategies.
With the help of these realizations, we have come up with a kit of solutions that can be implemented blazing fast so data-driven businesses would neither lose their competitive edge nor their customers and that are forever adapting and learning as the world changes.
All these solutions are powered by a real-time cognitive decisioning platform that utilizes stream analytics, machine learning and decision theory to tackle numerous use-cases across different industries. Specifically, we have come up with the concept of “Robots”, which are automated engines that can drive business outcomes by sensing the current state of the world, deciding and executing the best actions, observing the effects of the actions, and using the feedback to update their model of the world.",,Manager,Full Time,Engineering,4 applications,Posted 03 Jan 2019,Closing on 02 Feb 2019,Monthly,"$7,000-$10,000"
