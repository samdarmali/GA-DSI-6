Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.
Access to Expert IT Resources
Building a large, qualified team of internal IT staff to handle all of an enterprise’s needs is expensive and difficult. Using managed IT services ensures access to a complete team of IT experts.
Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.
Enhancing Your IT Compliance
Managed services for IT can help enterprises rapidly meet key governance and compliance requirements by handling critical security updates and other maintenance tasks.

Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings

Access to Expert IT Resources

Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.

It all started from the proposal in August 2004 by the Singapore Teachers’ Union (STU) to Ministry of Education of Singapore (MOE) to ease the workload of teachers so that they can focus on teaching, when Educare Human Capital (EHC) Private Limited piloted and implemented the Teacher Assistant Scheme. The scheme aimed to elevate teaching and teachers’ lives through the recruitment and management of TAs, as they assist the teachers administratively and operationally. The success of the scheme has since made EHC one of the most credible education manpower service providers amongst others, where it has been trusted with staffing within the realms of administration, ICT, laboratories, sports coaching and even management of the schools.
Today, EHC serves more than 200 Singapore schools, presenting itself as one of the principal Education Human Resource solutions providers in Singapore.
Beyond the schools, EHC has made its foray into other government sectors, and had clinched multiple contracts to provide manpower services for the government ministries and organisations, such as the Ministry of Home Affairs (Commercial Affairs Department), Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance (VITAL), The State Courts, Singapore Workforce Development Agency and Energy Market Authority. EHC has also explored business opportunities to the private sector within the education realm. EHC has deployed staff to international schools and institutions, which include ISS International School, Hollandse School Singapore, Tien Hsia Language Centre and others. Over the past 3 years, EHC’s total headcount within the government organisations (Non-MOE) and private sector grew by more than 300%, representing its broadening market presence.
Even as EHC continues to diversify its business, it never strays away from its founding philosophy and philanthropy. EHC has been and always will be striving to maintain at least 60% of its services to the schools in Singapore, so as to give back to schools and communities, where it shapes destinies through job creation, resolving unemployment and off-loading admin duties of teachers.",583 SERANGOON ROAD 218197,Senior Executive,Temporary,Admin / Secretarial,5 applications,Posted 24 Jan 2019,Closing on 23 Feb 2019,Monthly,"$2,000-$3,200"
