Deep in the heart of the old Chinese settlement, the church was the base from which the Methodist pioneer missionary, Dr. Benjamin West, reached out to the migrated Chinese. It was in 1889 when Dr. West rented a shophouse in Upper Nanking Street (now no more in existence) to practise medicine and to work as a missionary. He started 2 services on Sunday in August that year at the shophouse, preaching to a congregation of 30 people, speaking in Malay which was translated into Hokkien.
In 1905, the shophouse structure was falling apart, but the Church found a new worship place at No. 12 Japan Street (now Boon Tat Street). In 1913, the Church bought a piece of land at the junction of Telok Ayer Street and Cecil Street. A tent was erected on the site. The Church continued to grow but the tent was soon in a dilapidated state. The Church had to move temporarily to Fairfield Methodist Girls' School at Neil Road. Meanwhile, a zinc hut measuring 6m by 10 m in floor area was constructed on the same site and in September that year, the Church resumed its worship at Telok Ayer. In 1921, more land was acquired at an adjoining site. The zinc hut was demolished and a three-storey building was built on the larger land by a French firm, Bross and Mogin. The architect was Swan & Maclaren. The building was completed and the sanctuary was dedicated on 11 January 1925. In 1935, Dr. John Sung, a well-known Chinese evangelist from China, conducted revival meetings in the Church. World War II broke out in 1941 and Singapore fell into Japanese hands on 15 February 1941. The Church was used as a refuge for about 300 people. Countless members continued to be encouraged at the weekly Sunday services which did not stop throughout those difficult and trying years.
Amazingly, after so many years, the church building has kept to the original design with little alteration to the exterior look. The basic design is western: a rectangular main body sitting on arch colonnades. But the architecture added an open pavilion on the roof at the front of the building. The roof of the pavilion is carved in the traditional Chinese manner. By this addition, the basically Roman styled building is given a Chineseness that will speak to the migrant Chinese and be identified with them. The Church sanctuary is located at the second storey level. For country churches, it is natural to have the sanctuary on the first storey, but for city churches, it is more practical to have a second storey sanctuary. At the time of building, it was common for European city churches to locate the sanctuary on the second storey. In Singapore, Telok Ayer Church could be the first church building to adopt this design.

Because of our history and the uniqueness of our Church building, on 23 March 1989, the government announced that Telok Ayer Church would be preserved as a National Monument. That year also marked our Church's 100th Anniversary. A series of programmes were drawn up throughout that year for the centennial celebrations. In the following year, in response to the Government's preservation as National Monument, the Church embarked on a major extension and renovation work to restore the Church building to its original grandeur. Started in October 1993, the preservation and conservation project ended in August 1995 with a total cost of 3 million dollars. As we entered into the new Millennium, we launched a new church building project at the site of our former branch church at 61 Wishart Road, off Telok Blangah Road. The new church building known as TA2 houses an 800-seat sanctuary with modern audio-visual facilities and an education centre. The groundbreaking was held on 16 Feb 2003. TA2 was completed in November 2004 and a combined Christmas thanksgiving service was held there on 19 Dec 2004.

We've pioneered many of the most advanced and successful Agile methods of software development and best practices used in the industry today.

In other words, we build (amazing) software. It’s amazing because we build it with a complete obsession on doing the right thing for the user and the customer, and some quirky methods to get us there really quickly. It’s also amazing because it’s the stuff which makes or breaks companies; software which creates competitive advantage.

But that’s only part of the story. ThoughtWorks is a social and commercial community based on three pillars – (1) running a sustainable business -- which enables us to (2) deliver software excellence and (3) advocate for positive social change.

We see building software as a social activity, best done by teams of brilliant people, not a mechanistic process where individuals are interchangeable cogs in a master plan. Our hiring model focuses on finding outstanding talent, over the mastery of tools.

535,Head of SSO (APAC),SIX FINANCIAL INFORMATION SINGAPORE PTE. LTD.,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesThe SSO group provides business support services to the front line sales channels within the financial information business of SIX. The Head of SSO in APAC is the functional line leader for all staff who fall into the remit of the unit, working in close co-operation with the sales channel leaders and the local management structures. The Head of SSO APAC is the leader for this regional group, providing vision and direction for their reporting staff members. They are also expected to perform all senior management functions for the group including staff selection, motivation and management, performance and delivery management and financial reporting and control. Finance and HR support is provided by the functional teams of those groups. In this particular case (APAC) the location of the teams are Singapore and Tokyo but in aggregate is not a large team and hence it is expected that the incumbent will also play a part directly with customers and potential customers. To this end, experience in regulatory and compliance requirements in the middle and back office, and the underlying data requirements that these create would be a distinct advantage. The role reports into Head Business Development, MPP.RequirementsMain Duties 1. A key positive aspect of the SIX engagement model with clients is the quality and expertise of the staff and resources we deploy is support of the sales force during the sales process. The Regional Manager Role in SSO role is primarily responsible for the delivery and management of product, service and sales support in the defined region. Some regions will operate on a ‘hub and spoke’ basis where a number of countries are supported as ‘spokes’ from the central location. The rational for this is to allow the development of resources in strength and depth and to allow the limited support staff in smaller countries to access the resources and expertise of an entire department easily and quickly. 2. The Regional Manager will organize and manage resources on a regional basis to provide effective sales support to the three sales channels. It is envisaged that these services will include data consulting, integration services, API and interfacing training and consulting and client facing project management, i.e. to facilitate the sales of our complete offering of products and services both technically and administratively. 3. Functionally, this will cover pre-sales support, quote/proposal production, support for entitlements set up, delivery and installation etc. In most of these elements, there is the need to liaise effectively with the global group who have ultimate responsibility for the function e.g. Finance, Legal, Technology etc. 4. Resources (both in terms of quantity and skill set) should be planned so that support can be economically and efficiently provided where it is required, with some skills provided locally, and others provided regionally (or in a few cases globally) to achieve the economies of scale and scope. Where possible and sensible, these should map onto the organization of the sales channels to foster a close and supportive working relationship. 5. Certain team members will also take on responsibility for ‘Expert Support’ working closely with GDO, MPP and the Partner business . This will mainly be for problems or service/content deficiencies that need to be pro-actively managed to a successful conclusion on a client-by-client basis over a period of time. We expect that the majority of the ‘Expert Support’ is actually provided by the Project Managers – they manage the long term problems to resolution and are well placed to manage the expectations of the client – something that a helpdesk by its very nature cannot do easily. It addition, SSO will have the domain experts that may well be required for analysis of detailed or ongoing problems. The Regional Manager may well get involved in particularly difficult or high visibility problems, including leading to a resolution. 6. Many projects will involve working alongside business partners by offering integration support for SIX data into a partner’s solution, or integrating an element from the partner into a solution provided by SIX. The SSO group will work closely with the Partners team to deliver such integration and project support. Of particular importance here is the recognition, protection and growth of the value that SIX adds into the overall solution such that we do not get marginalized by an aggressive partner. It is also important that such solutions lead to repeatable, high value sales opportunities for SIX, rather than remaining as ‘once-off’ deals. Your Profile We are looking for a self-starter who can work independently yet be equally comfortable working within a team within a matrix organisation.  A solid understanding of Market Regulation and its impact on Financial institutions and regulatory topics is necessary, as is a general knowledge of a variety of asset classes (Equity, Fixed Income, Commodity, Funds and FX markets).  An appreciation of the compliance and regulatory framework within financial institutions.  Good presentation, documentation and communication (oral and written) skills. Ability to build strong relationships with prospects, clients and internal stakeholders and document detailed requirements.  A solid understanding of Sales and Project Management lifecycles.  Demonstrate enthusiasm to learn about, and maintain, their knowledge of the details of the market, including regulation, competitive positioning, technical issues around data delivery and current ‘hot topics’ in the industry.","SIX FINANCIAL INFORMATION SINGAPORE PTE.
