Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.
Access to Expert IT Resources
Building a large, qualified team of internal IT staff to handle all of an enterprise’s needs is expensive and difficult. Using managed IT services ensures access to a complete team of IT experts.
Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.
Enhancing Your IT Compliance
Managed services for IT can help enterprises rapidly meet key governance and compliance requirements by handling critical security updates and other maintenance tasks.

Why Use Managed IT Services?
Some key benefits of using managed IT services include:
Cost Savings
Managed IT services can help you reduce your overall IT spend and cost of ownership by focusing on proactive IT management over unpredictable break-fix strategies. This reduces productivity loss and other impacts of waiting until your infrastructure breaks to employ a hotfix.
Access to Expert IT Resources
Building a large, qualified team of internal IT staff to handle all of an enterprise’s needs is expensive and difficult. Using managed IT services ensures access to a complete team of IT experts.
Easing Your Enterprise IT Burden
Another benefit of having access to a team of IT experts from your managed IT services partner is that it frees up your own internal IT support department so they can focus on tasks that drive your core business.

498,Senior Product Manager,TRANSFERWISE SINGAPORE PTE. LTD.,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesWe’re looking for a Senior Product Manager to join our growing Product team in our Singapore office. The role is a unique opportunity to build world-beating, world-class products, focusing on the Asia region. Your mission:  You mission is to define the future of TransferWise in Asia, with a focus in South Asia or South East Asia. It's a huge challenge, but an exciting one. You'll figure out how we can revolutionise international money transfers for customers in across the region, and helping us achieve our mission of Money without Borders. You'll lead by example - not only will you lead a product team yourself, but we'd love it if you could help other diverse and autonomous product teams. This means understanding their potential and providing insights and data where necessary. As we are a data focused company, it helps to know what makes each of the teams tick to make sure they are focusing on the proper KPIs. Communication and inspiration - you'll be responsible for understanding the why and how of the product so you can communicate the TransferWise story to anyone - from your banker to their grandmother. As we're having many satellite teams, it's important that you communicate product changes so that they stay in the loop.  This role will give you the opportunity to:  Be flexible in how and where you work, we understand everyone needs a little something different so we’ll do our best to make it happen. Travel to work with our teams in different offices as well as meet various partners and organisations when needed. Inspire teams with your ideas, knowledge and self-starting attitude. RequirementsA bit about you:  Extensive experience in product management. You are customer-focused. At TransferWise, customers always come first. You need to be enthusiastic about our customers. We are a company doing great things, but we couldn’t do it without our customers being ready to start a revolution. You are passionate about Asia. The Asia region spans from India to the Philippines to Japan. It is incredibly diverse, and also you recognise that to be successful there, you'll have to do things a little differently than in Europe. You have the empathy for that. You are entrepreneurial, either you have run your own company or delivered high impact projects. You need to have ideas. You’re going to change the world, so we want to see what exceptional ideas you’ve had before. You are someone who loves to get things done - you make things happen instead of wondering why things happened. You are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and take responsibility. We do not hire people just to manage other people. We expect you to deliver results directly. Have a head for numbers.You are data-driven. You need to be able to prioritise the value you can add to customers, and numbers are the best way to do this. You can give examples of how you have moved some metrics before. Have some technical knowledge. You may have started out your career as an engineer or maybe it's a secret passion. Either way you need to be able to communicate effectively with our product engineers.  Some extra skills that would be awesome:  You had experience working with debit/credit cards, banks, and payment networks You had experience working with international teams across different locations ","Who we are
TransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission: Money without borders - so people and businesses can send and receive any currency effortlessly, whenever, wherever.
The heart of what we do is international money transfer. We’re committed to making it instant, convenient and fair for millions of people, all over the world. And we’re growing our other products and our teams at an exciting pace. And we’re looking for the very best to jump on board.
What it’s really like to work here
At TransferWise, we do things a bit differently. There’s no corporate nonsense, and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in dozens of self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up that learn from each other.
Each team picks the problems they want to solve. So there’s no micro-management. No hiding behind fancy job titles. And no one telling you what to do. You are your own boss. But you’ll get tons of guidance and plenty of support from talented, super-smart colleagues from all over TransferWise.
We’re going to be upfront — the way we work doesn’t suit everyone. But if freedom, autonomy, and life-affirming, head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.","APERIA, 12 KALLANG AVENUE 339511",Manager,Full Time,Information Technology,10 applications,Posted 14 Jan 2019,Closing on 13 Feb 2019,Monthly,"$10,000-$14,000"
