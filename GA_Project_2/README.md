# General Assembly - Data Science Immersive: Project 2

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. The focus on EDA challenged me to visualize the data through a variety of plotting problems, testing my proficiency with plotting libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib. 

More importantly, it challenged me to discover patterns within the data, spot anomalies, and to test hypotheses. In short, the project demonstrated the importance of understanding the data and extracting as many insights as possible from it before any modeling is done.
