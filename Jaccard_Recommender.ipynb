    "# Building the Recommender System (Jaccard Similarity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Classical Recommendation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similar people** (**Collaborative Filtering**)\n",
    "    - If you like the same 5 movies as someone else, you'll likely enjoy other movies they like.\n",
    "    - There are two main types: (a) Find users who are similar and recommend what they like (**user-based**), or (b) recommend items that are similar to already-liked items (**item-based**).\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similar items** (**Content-based Filtering**)\n",
    "    - If you enjoy certain characteristics of movies (e.g. certain actors, genre, etc.), you'll enjoy other movies with those characteristics.\n",
    "    - Note this can easily be done using machine learning methods! Each movie can be decomposed into features. Then, for each user we compute a model -- the target can be a binary classifier (e.g. \"LIKE\"/\"DISLIKE\") or regression (e.g. star rating).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Types of Similarity\n",
    "1. **PEARSON CORRELATION:** This method is most commonly used method. This method is used to find linear correlation between two vectors. PCC results a value between -1 and +1. -1 represents a negative corelation while +1 represents high positive correlation. 0 value shows no relation sometimes called zero order correlation. For the user-based algorithm, Pearson correlation is given in Table 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CONSTRAINED PEARSON CORRELATION:** Constrained Pearson correlation uses median value instead of average of rating co-rated by both users. Median value of scale is 3. For the user-based algorithm, Constrained Pearson correlation is given in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **COSINE SIMILARITY:** This method is also most commonly used method in collaborative filtering in recommender systems. Cosine similarity finds how two vectors are related to each other using measuring cosine angle between these vectors. For the user-based algorithm, Cosine similarity is given in Table 1. The major drawback with cosine similarity is that it considers null preferences as negative preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ADJUSTED COSINE SIMILARITY:** Cosine similarity measure does not consider the scenario in which different users use different rating scale. Adjusted cosine similarity solves it by subtracting the average rating provided by the user. Adjusted cosine similarity considers the difference in rating scale used by each user. Adjusted cosine similarity is slightly different from Pearson Correlation; Pearson Correlation considers the average rating of user for co-rated the items. Adjusted cosine similarity subtracts the average rating of user for all the items rated by user. For the user-based algorithm, Adjusted cosine similarity is given in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **JACCARD SIMILARITY:** Jaccard similarity takes number of preferences common between two users into account. This does not consider the absolute ratings rather it considers number of items rated. Two users will be more similar, when two users have more common rated items. For the user-based algorithm, Jaccard similarity is given in Table 1. Jaccard produces limited number of values which makes the task of user distinction difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **MEAN SQUARED DIFFERENCES:** For the user-based algorithm, MSD similarity is given in Table 1. MSD does not consider number of common rating rather it considers absolute ratings. Various similarity measures have been proposed in combination of jaccard similarity as JMSD, JPSS. Jaccard and MSD similarity can be combined to form another similarity measure method JMSD. For the user-based algorithm, JMSD similarity is given in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **PIP SIMILARITY:** PIP stands for Proximity, Impact, Popularity. Proximity factor calculates the arithmetic difference between two ratings, along with consideration of agreement or disagreement of ratings, giving penalty to ratings in disagreement. Two ratings occurs in agreement if they lie on one side of the median of the rating scale. The Impact factor represents the extent to which an item is preferred or disliked by users. If two users have rated 1 on an item, it will show more strong dislike than they rate 3. Popularity is calculated around average rating of item provided by all users. Popularity gives high similarity when average of two rating far from average ratings of the item. If both users average rating has a large difference with the average of total users’ ratings, the two ratings can provide more information about the similarity of the two users. For the user-based algorithm, PIP similarity is given in Table 1. The Development of PIP was based on utilizing domain specific interpretation of user ratings on products It was developed to overcome the weakness of traditional similarity and distance measures in new user cold-start conditions. PIP performed well for new user cold-start conditions. PIP penalizes on proximity as well as Impact when there is disagreement in ratings. Sometimes it misleads about the similarity between similar users and similarity between dissimilar users. To overcome the problem faced by PIP, a new similarity measure was developed based on sigmoid function, called PSS an improved PIP measure. PSS stands for Proximity, significance, similarity. For the user-basedalgorithm, PSS similarity is given in Table 1. Proximity of two ratings is computed as in PIP. The second factor was taken as significance. Significance of two ratings was based on the median value of rating scale. It is based on the concept that the ratings, more distant from the median value, would be more significant. Singularity defines how two rating different from other ratings. PSS can be combined with Jaccard similarity measure. For the user-based algorithm, JPSS is given in Table 1.Where JPSS uses an improved version of Jaccard similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **NEW HEURISTIC SIMILARITY MODEL (NHSM):** For this method, PIP has been taken as initial heuristic method. NHSM similarity measure is combination of JPSS and User Rating Preference similarity measures. User Rating Preference similarity measure is based on mean and variance of the ratings of user. For the user-based algorithm, NHSM similarity measure is given in Table 1. The value produced by NHSM ranges from 0 to 1. This similarity measure considers the fact that different users have different preferences scale and models user preference based on mean and standard variance of user ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **SPEARMAN RANK CORRELATION:** Spearman Rank Correlation uses ranks instead of ratings for calculating similarity. For the user-based algorithm, Spearman Correlation is given in Table 1. Spearman Rank Correlation does not work well for partial orderings. Weak orderings occur whenever there are at least two items in the ranking such that neither item is preferred over the other. If there is difference between user ranking ordering and system ordering. When the system ranks same rated items at different levels, then the Spearman correlation will be penalized for every pair of items rated same by the user. Since the user shouldn’t care the system orders items that the user has rated at the same level. Kendall’s Tau metric also suffers from the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **KENDALL’S TAU CORRELATION:** This is also rank based method to compute correlation. Kendall’s correlation considers relative ranks instead of ratings for calculating similarity. It computes the correlation of the rankings that is independent of the variable values. Kendall’s correlation suffers from the same problem faced by Spearman correlation.\n",
